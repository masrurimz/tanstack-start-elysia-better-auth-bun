# State Management

## Jotai Pattern

- Use Jotai for state management when state needs to be shared across components
- Create atoms in controllers or dedicated state files
- Use `useAtomValue` for read-only access and `useSetAtom` for write-only access
- Avoid using `useAtom` when you only need to read or write, not both
- Expose atoms through controller methods for component consumption

## Reference Files

- Example controllers: [auth-controller.ts](mdc:src/features/auth/_controllers/auth-controller.ts)
